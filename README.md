# Front End Test

## Objective:

To assess your ability to develop a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using a JavaScript framework or vanilla JavaScript. While we're looking for Kintone developers, this test will evaluate your foundational skills in web development.

## Task:

Create a simple table application that allows users to:

- Add new rows to the table with specified data.
- Edit existing rows and update their data.
- Delete rows from the table.

## Requirements:

- **Technology**: Choose any JavaScript framework or library you are comfortable with (e.g., React, Vue, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript).
- **Data Storage**: Use the provided JSON Server.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface with clear labels and input fields.
- **Functionality**: Ensure the CRUD operations work as expected, with proper error handling and validation.
- **State Management**: Implement state management using a suitable approach for your chosen framework (e.g., Redux, Pinia, useState/useReducer).

### Additional Considerations (optional):

- **Responsiveness**: Consider how your application will adapt to different screen sizes.

## Submission:

- Create a public GitHub repository with format "case-study-[nama-anda]"
- Send the link to the repository via email to bella@aqi.co.id and cc to aulya.khatulistivani@aqi.co.id, taufiqurahman.alghani@aqi.co.id & muhamad.rifaldi@aqi.co.id with title [Nama-anda]-Kintone-AQI

## Evaluation Criteria:

- **Functionality**: Correct implementation of CRUD operations.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured, and maintainable code.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Problem-Solving**: Ability to handle edge cases and errors.
- **Framework/Library Usage**: Effective use of chosen technology, including state management.
